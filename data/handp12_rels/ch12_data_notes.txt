The fields
-------------------------------------
1. number
2. page number
3. the section number it hails from (eg 3.2.2). This can be cross referenced with the expanded outline file. 
4. the example number (eg 12 iv)
5. boolean value corresponding to grammatical status
6. boolean value corresponding to sentence status (ie non-fragment)
7. boolean value corresponding to relative construction status 
8. inline label identifier (eg wh-relative, fused-relative, non-cleft etc)
9. the text of the exemplar


Notes on phenomenon label field
----------------------------------

labels beginning with ~ indicate that either no label was explicitly provided
and one was inferred from the context, or that the label was massaged somewhat
to make it make more sense independent of its context

no label was explicitly provided and I
have inferred the label from the context.

'or'  indicates ambiguity between the two
'and' indicates both labels apply

When a simple syntactic category is specified as the phenomenon type/label (eg
clause, NP, AdjP) it is illustrating the types of constituents that can be
relativised for the current kind of relative construction being discussed.


Notes text field
----------------------------------

The text field of each exemplar contains markup which is explained below. This
will all be stripped out when creating profiles for parsing.

[...]    delimits the span that is the relative clause 
{...}    delimits a span that is a referent
__       indicates a gap corresponding to a referent

non-binary grammaticality judgements in H&P
p1041 14.ii.c
p1042 17.i.b
p1045 29.ii.b
p1051 53.ii
p1053 61.ii
p1055 68.i, 68.ii, 68.iii
p1074 18.iii, 18.iv
p1078 30iii (alternate paraphrase)
p1083 15.iii.b
p1087 27.ii
p1089 33.ii
p1091 38.iii
p1092 40.iii

Each of these is marked as one of the following:
? -- of questionable grammaticality
!  -- non-standard
# -- semantically or pragmatically anomalous
% -- grammatical in some dialects only


Misc Item notes
----------------------------------

18 is not a fused relative
28=31
37=40
38=41
39=42
57, 58, 60, 61: the fine grained labels for these complex relatives could be further inferred with some thought.
303 is ambiguous between a relative construction and a purpose adjunct 
336 is ambiguous 
339 is ambiguous

TODO:
Go through and identify minimal pairs that H&P used
extract for use in Typediff

Complex relatives subtypes:
--------------------------------------
Type I:    comp of preposition -> PP
Type II:   PP -> NP
Type III:  PP -> AdjP
Type IV:   NP -> infinitival
Type V:    NP -> gerund-participial
Type VI:   genitive whose -> NP
Type VII:  determinative which -> NP
