147@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I knew that it was my sister 's voice .@@@@1@10@@nejl@16-3-2013

149@unknown@formal@none@1@S@As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle , such as my sister described , and a few moments later a clanging sound , as if a mass of metal had fallen .@@@@1@37@@nejl@16-3-2013

152@unknown@formal@none@1@S@By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening , her face blanched with terror , her hands groping for help , her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard .@@@@1@40@@nejl@16-3-2013
153@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground .@@@@1@28@@nejl@16-3-2013
154@unknown@formal@none@1@S@She writhed as one who is in terrible pain , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed .@@@@1@17@@nejl@16-3-2013

162@unknown@formal@none@1@S@When he reached my sister 's side she was unconscious , and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village , all efforts were in vain , for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness .@@@@1@46@@nejl@16-3-2013
163@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister . "@@@@1@11@@nejl@16-3-2013

165@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Could you swear to it ? "@@@@1@7@@nejl@16-3-2013
166@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry .@@@@1@13@@nejl@16-3-2013
167@unknown@formal@none@1@S@It is my strong impression that I heard it , and yet , among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house , I may possibly have been deceived . "@@@@1@35@@nejl@16-3-2013

173@unknown@formal@none@1@S@And what conclusions did the coroner come to ? "@@@@1@10@@nejl@16-3-2013
174@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" He investigated the case with great care , for Dr. Roylott 's conduct had long been notorious in the county , but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death .@@@@1@34@@nejl@16-3-2013
175@unknown@formal@none@1@S@My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night .@@@@1@33@@nejl@16-3-2013
176@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the flooring was also thoroughly examined , with the same result .@@@@1@29@@nejl@16-3-2013

180@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" How about poison ? "@@@@1@6@@nejl@16-3-2013
181@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" The doctors examined her for it , but without success . "@@@@1@13@@nejl@16-3-2013
182@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of , then ? "@@@@1@15@@nejl@16-3-2013
183@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock , though what it was that frightened her I can not imagine . "@@@@1@28@@nejl@16-3-2013

187@unknown@formal@none@1@S@" Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium , sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people , perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation .@@@@1@36@@nejl@16-3-2013
