Typediff
========

A tool for exploring derivations produced by DELPH-IN HPSG grammars.
The DELPH-IN consortium is a worldwide collaboration that develops
open source tools and resources for efficient and deep processing of
natural language.  For more information visit http://www.delph-in.net.

Typediff enables users to interactively compare and contrast the
resultant analyses of sets of input text. By comparing similar
sentences, differing with respect to specific grammatical phenomena,
users can rapidly determine which grammar internal components are
involved in the processing of specific phenomena.  Typediff has both a
browser-based and command line interface. For more information see
the file [docs/typediff.md](docs/typediff.md).

For installation instructions see
