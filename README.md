grammalytics
============

A set of tools for mining, analyzing and exploring derivations
produced by DELPH-IN HPSG grammars.  The DELPH-IN consortium is a
worldwide collaboration that develops open source tools and
resources for efficient and deep processing of natural language.

Tools found within:

Typediff
--------

Typediff enables users to interactively compare and contrast the
resultant analyses of sets of input text. By comparing similar
sentences, differing with respect to specific grammatical phenomena,
users can rapidly determine which grammar internal components are
involved in the processing of specific phenomena.  Typediff has both a
browser-based and command line interface. For more information see
the file typediff.mk.


Parseit 
-------

Parseit is a command line tool for manipulating DELPH-IN derivations.
Parseit supports extracting specific attributes from derivations,
counting the distribution of these attributes over profiles, and
converting derivations into other formats. For more information see
the file parseit.mk.
